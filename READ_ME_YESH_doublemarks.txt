###notes and key for "2012_2024_replacement_tags_doublemarks" YESH CMR data, Malta


#Original_ring - primary metal ring placed on individual 
#Replacement_ring - ring replacing primary metal ring on that individual, due to wear or loss
#DateReplacement - date of session when Original_ring was replaced by Replacement_ring
	#in case of more than one replacement for an individual, the 2nd ring will be listed in Original_ring in another row and #the 3rd ring will be in Replacement_ring

#DoubleTag  were either:
#Pit_tag - Darvic rings with unique tri-alphanumeric code used to attach Pit tags in light pollution study (Austad et al. 2023)
#F_ring_additional - secondary ring of larger size than those usually used for Yelkouan shearwaters in order to attach GLS in Greetham et al. (in prep)
#doubletags were placed on the other leg, opposite the metal ring


#DoubleTagON - date when the Pit_tag or F_ring_additional were placed
#DoubleTagOFF - known date of double mark removal OR last encounter we noted down the tag OR last encounter date if we did not remove tag

#LostRing - 1 shearwater was encountered with only the doubletag and without the Original_ring
#in case of PIT tagged shearwaters, a new metal ring would have been placed
#in case of F-ringed shearwaters, the F ring would be the replacement ring and no additional ring was placed. 

#3 other lost rings were found (1 in Mist net after ringing session and two in cave entrances) but these were not detected due to double ringing; and connot really contribute to tag loss rate!?
